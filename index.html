Things I know so far in HTML:
<ul type="square">
    <li>Basic Broiler Plate</li>
    <li>Heading Tags</li>
    <li>Ordered / Unordered Lists</li>
    <li>Basic Font Formatting</li>
    <li>Insertion of Images</li>
    <li>Basic Paragraph Formatting</li>
</ul>
<p>These few topic consists my basic knowledge of HTML, which, in here I am looking forward to explain along with its utilities. So let's get started!</p>

<br><br>

<ol type="i">
    <li><h3>Basic Broiler Plate</h3></li>
    <p>The broiler plate is the main structure for formulating any web page. It basically gives a skeletal structure to put things in order, consisting mainly of the head and the body.</p>
    <p>The Head contains the details of the page such as its title, the meta tags or if the HTML file have any sort of attached style sheets, etc. It's not included in the visible area of a running web page.</p>
    <p>Then comes the Body, which contains almost everything we see in a web page. It contains numerous tags and texts and designs required to build a webpage as per convinience.</p>

    <br><br>

    <li><h3>Heading Tags</h3></li>
    <p>As the simple name suggests, it is a tag, especially used for adding heading to a HTML file. There are six heading tags, ranging from h1 to h6 respectively, where h1 privides with the largest and h6 with the smallest. 
        <h1>This is the h1 tag in use!</h1>
        <h6>And here comes the h6 one!</h6>
    </p>

    <br><br>

    <li><h3>Ordered / Unordered Lists</h3></li>
    <p>The order and unordered list tags are used for making ordered and unordered lists. Order lists are lists where we use 1, 2, 3... or A, B, C... or I, II, III... for numbering to know the specific location of an item in a list. Whereas in an unordered list the items are represented with bullets of differnt types. Here is an example of each of them respectively.
        <ol type="A"> This is an ordered list:
            <li>1st Item</li>
            <li>2nd Item</li>
            <li>3rd Item</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <ul type="circle"> This is an unordered list:
            <li>1st Item</li>
            <li>2nd Item</li>
            <li>3rd Item</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <br><br>

    <li><h3>Basic Font Formatting</h3></li>
    <p>We can design and decorate our fonts using certain fornt attributes. Such as for changing a font colour we can use the attribute color with the font tag. Or for changing the style of the font we can use face attribute. We can also resize a fint as per our choice.
    <br>
    <center><font color="teal" face="algerian" size="5">This is a sample text!</font></center>
    </p>

    <br><br>

    <li><h3>Insertion of Images</h3></li>
    Images are what makes a dull scene to a interesting one. So HTML allows us to insert images in our web pages by the img tag with the src attribute. It also allows us to change the size of our images by the height and width attributes respectively. Here's a pretty picture of the nature.
    <br><br>
    <center><img src="nature01.jpg" height="250" width="250"></center>

    <br><br>

    <li><h3>Basic Paragraph Formatting</h3></li>
    <p>Paragraph tag helps in chunking of a part of a text in a well presented form, rather than just going on typing it out. In this document most of the texts are well presented using the p tag. The br tag is also often used to leave a blank space in between paragraphs or whereever needed.</p>
